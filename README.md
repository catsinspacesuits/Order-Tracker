# README

This app was built to help Deliveroo bike couriers keep track of the distances they cycle/drive and how much they get paid for each delivery. Because a new payment scheme is being introduced at the company, I was asked to build an app that helped couriers decide which contract option best suited their needs.

The app uses the HTML5 Geolocation API to allow users to add the coordinates of their current position. They can use this to record coordinates at their start point, restaurant and customer locations. The app uses this data to calculate the distances between these points. Users can view all of their own orders or the orders of all couriers combined and can export this data in CSV and XLS format to enable them to analyse it in Excel.

You can see the live version of the app [here](https://fast-headland-61235.herokuapp.com/)
